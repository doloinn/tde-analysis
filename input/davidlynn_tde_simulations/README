To run the simulations simply use:
bash /path/to/run_simulations.sh /path/to/Gibis/directory
If /path/to/Gibis/directory is not provided . is assumed; i.e. that the script is being run from the Gibis directory. The command used to run GIBIS itself may need to be changed to suit the user's setup.

Example run would be place this directory somewhere (e.g. in ~), cd into directory, run `bash sun_simulations /gibis/gaia/cu2/Gibis'.

The script uses a placeholder input file and replaces the source file parameter (using sed) with the source files found in the galaxy_source_files and tde_source_files directories iteratively.
